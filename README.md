# Cassava Disease Classification

## Dataset
The dataset consists of leaf images of the cassava plant, 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala.

## Goal
Implement useful technique in images classification task to speed up training process and increase accuracy, such as:
- Image augmentation in neural network graph.
- Tensorflow mixed precision
- Model bagging
- Test time augmentation
